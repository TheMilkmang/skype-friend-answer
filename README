This is just a simple script to auto answer skype calls for only specific contacts. The auto-answer feature for skype only allows either everyone or no one to be auto answered. It uses Skype4Py, and is included. There's a lot that still needs to be done...

To use, just run AutoAnswer.py followed by the skype username(s) of the contact you want to auto answer for. 

"python AutoAnswer.py echo123"

"python AutoAnswer.py echo123 someGuyMcGee SomeOtherChap"

Hopefully I eventually add a gui...
